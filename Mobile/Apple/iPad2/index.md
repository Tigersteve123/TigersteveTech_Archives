### Notes

This was the family's first tablet when I was growing up. I still have fond memories of playing Minecraft Pocket Lite with friends on this iPad. Unfortunately, iOS 9 (the last supported version) runs quite poorly on this hardware and makes the device almost unusable with some apps. The screen on my device seems degraded (it shows visible burn-in at some times) and is slightly lifted at the bottom right corner from a dent likely caused by the tablet being dropped before.
