### Notes
This machine was quite special to me because I spent about a day shoveling snowed-in driveways to buy it. Interestingly, it looked like it was refurbished. There was barely any dust in it when I got it, and there were no bulging or blown capacitors. I was most surprised to find that there was no thermal paste on the CPU heatsink. Instead, it looked like it had a metal sheet glued to it. I am not sure if this was standard and shipped out of the factory, but I had not before and have not since seen something like that. It shipped without a hard drive, so I added an IDE that I took from the PCI PC. I ended up taking the hard drive rails from this one and using them in the Precision 370.
