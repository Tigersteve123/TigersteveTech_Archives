### Notes
I decided to archive this computer after upgrading the memory because the old Apple Fusion Drive died. It was a work computer, so it unfortunately went to the Apple store for repairs (company policy prevented them from changing the system configuration so in went another "Fusion Drive"). To be fair, the drives were abused: swap often totaled above physical memory, so the poor already-small SSD was being hit with extra writes from caching and swapping. Yet another one of Apple's design decisions ended up resulting in reduced longetivity, but it seems that that is what they are going for.
